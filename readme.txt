This plugin looks up the context of quotes made using the "blockquote" and "q" tag.

== Description ==

This plugin allows writers to provide greater context to quotations they quote using a "cite" attributed url.  The plugin passes the quote on to the Neotext.net web service, which calculates the text preceding and succeeding each quote.  The contextual information is displayed through a jQuery dialog popup or though hidden text, which becomes visible when a reader clicks on the injected red arrows.

This plugin adds 2 buttons to the graphical editor: one for blockquotes and one for "q" tags
